# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I believe understanding user needs and turning them into a program involves figuring out what users want and then designing features that meet those needs. Creating “User stories” helps with what needs to be done by providing the developers and stakeholders with clear, understandable requirements. User stories also help with prioritization, meaning looking at the stories and their value, a team can decide on what needs to be done first. Furthermore, user stories also help to set the acceptance criteria, which ensure that the final product meets user needs.
